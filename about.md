Dear reader,

First of all thank you very much for coming to my technical blog! Really appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. 

I am Soumik and I am a passionate hands on developer/architect who specialises in Java and related technologies. I've started my career long back as Java & HTML developer and have then gradually evolved as a programmer and played various roles of Java lead / architect for java based enterprise applications. Also I have played the role of technical project manager for sometime in my career and this phase also taught me some valuable management principles and the challenges of managing a software project and how best it can be done! For the last few years, I also got the opportunity to be exposed to various Cloud providers like AWS & GCP  and NoSQL databses like (MongoDB and Redis).

I love to learn (and share) interesting new tech stuff and my current interests include docker and  microservices...and also to write clean code ! My passion is to find out the cleanest and leanest solution to a problem and am an ardent believer in clean code and KISS principle!

In this blog, I have shared some of my learnings and I would be keen to know your valuable fdeedback at my email account (msoumik78@gmail.com)

With regards
Soumik
