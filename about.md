Hi - I am Soumik and I am a hands on developer and architect. Started my career long back as Java & HTML developer and have then played roles of Java lead / architect for java based enterprise applications. Recently got exposed to AWS, NoSQL (MongoDB and Redis) and Map Reduce framework.
Loves to learn (and share) interesting new tech stuff and current interests include docker and  microservices...loves to find out the cleanest and leanest solution to a problem and am an ardent believer in clean code and KISS principle!
