# Project Lombok makes Java cool again  

For all of us who have witnessed from inside the progress of mainstream Java development over the years, we are all fascinated by the power and 
cleanness brought in by lombok annotations.

For the uninitiated - Project lombok has introduced some cool annotations which relieve you from writing a lot of routine boiler plate code and hence keeps your source Java 
file smaller and cleaner. Below are some most popular examples of the lombok annotations:

* **@Getter** - This when annotated on top of the class generates all the getter accessor methods corresponding to all the class variables and following the Java bean naming convention. 
* **@Setter**  - Similar as above but it generates the setter methods of all class variables.
* **@ToString** - 
* **@Equals** 
* **@Hashcode**
