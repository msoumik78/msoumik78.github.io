# Project Lombok makes Java cool again  

For all of us who have witnessed from inside (whcih means we worked as Java developers/architects) the progress of mainstream Java development over the years, needles to mention that we are all fascinated by the power and cleanness brought in by lombok annotations. Please also refer top the official lombok project [here](https://projectlombok.org/ "Project Lombok").

For the uninitiated - Project lombok has introduced some really **cool annotations** which relieve you from writing a lot of routine boiler plate code and hence *keeps your source Java file smaller and hence cleaner*. Below are some most popular examples of the lombok annotations:

* **@Getter** - This when annotated on top of the class generates all the getter accessor methods corresponding to all the class variables and following the Java bean naming convention. 

* **@Setter**  - Similar as above but it generates the setter methods of all class variables.

* **@ToString** - It generates the toString() implementation as per standard conventions. 

* **@Equals** - It generates the equals() implementation as per standard conventions.

* **@Hashcode** - It generates the hashcode() implementation as per standard conventions.
