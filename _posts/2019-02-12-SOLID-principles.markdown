# SOLID principles

One of the fundamental aspects of any good object oriented design is its degree of compliance to SOLID principles. In a nutshell, SOLID means the following:
* S - Single Responsibility Principle
* O - Open Close Principle
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle
* I - Interface Segregation Principle
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle
This states that a class should have only one purpose and in general, it should be changed for only one reason. The granularity of a OO design is a matter of taste and might be inapropriate for others.
Some examples of clear violations of SRP are as follows:
* Performing business logic in the DAO/ Persistence layer
* Performing complex business logic in the view / controller layer in a MVC architecture

## Open Closed Principle

## Liskov Substitution Principle

## Interface Segregation Principle

## Dependency Inversion Principle
