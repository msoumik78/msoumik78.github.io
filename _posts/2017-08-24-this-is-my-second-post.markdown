# MongoDB

MongoDB
is one of the most popular document oriented databases which is a major type of
NoSQL database.  The document oriented databases closely resemble RDBMS in the sense
that the data is stored in form of documents (which are similar to rows in RDBMS) and the 
documents are stored in collections (which are similar to tables in RDBMS).  
The biggest difference with RDBMS is that the documents are indeed meant for storing semi 
structured data and also the documents are completely schema free. This means that in MongoDB
you can go ahead and store documents in collections without even creating the collection
in the first place. This also means that MongoDb insert operations are much
faster than corresponding insert operations of RDBMS.
