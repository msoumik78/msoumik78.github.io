## Jenkins and its role in Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment lifecycle

I think all of us are aware of the need of the DevOps/CI-CD in this world when we are working in Agile based projects ans strive for quick builds and deployments. Undoubtedly Jenkins is one of the primary touls that is used to setup a build and deployment pipeline which helps in building software and pushing/deploying the updated/latest version of the software to the target environments.

Some other tools which execute similar tasks as Jenkins include Bamboo(from Atlassian) , Teamcity, Hudson,  etc.
