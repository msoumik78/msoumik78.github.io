# How to write clean Java code

One of the fundamental aspects that I have learnt progressibvely over time as a software engineer is the value of clean code. Honestly I never realized the value when I was
only a junior programmer. But now looking back I realize - how critically important for a tech savvy company to have clean code to minimize the technical debt over time.

So in this blog, I am going to present some very basic but really helpful tips to write clean code. So here you go:

* **Tip 1 - Use intention revealing names of classes, methods and objects** 

* **Tip 2 - Use smaller methods and classes** 

* **Tip 3 - Use comments very sparingly**

* **Tip 4 - Use strategy design pattern and avoid if/else statement as much as possible**
